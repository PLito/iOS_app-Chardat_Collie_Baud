# iOS_app


The project gathers Pierre-Loup CHARDAT, Romain BAUD, Kilian COLLIE.
The project consists in creating an app listing bars and pint prices in Odense. 
This project was inspired by "MrGoodBeer", an app that helps to find cheap bars and cheap pints in France. As this app is very useful but does not exist in Denmark, we want to create a similar, but simpler app for the centre of Odense.

From a technical point of view, this project will allow us to get familiar with XCode, Swift, SwiftUI and MVVMs, which we are all discovering. As additional features, we want to use:
- A data store with a database for the price of pints in each bar;
- Web service calls with the need to get a map and locations of bars in Odense;
- iOS features, especially GPS.

The current idea of the application is that it opens on a map centred on the position of the device. Around it, you would find dots showing the different bars and the price of the cheapest pint. Some additional elements could be added depending on the time remaining and the difficulties encountered (refined searches, type of beers, discounts, a page listing the bars in ascending order of beer price, possibilities for the user to add a comment or maybe even a bar).
